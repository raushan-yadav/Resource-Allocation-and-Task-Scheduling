# Python Scheduling Optimization Framework

A Python-based framework for modeling and solving
resource-constrained task scheduling problems using optimization techniques.

---

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of **scheduling and optimization
concepts** using Python. It focuses on solving **resource-constrained task
scheduling problems**, where tasks must be assigned to limited resources
while respecting constraints such as precedence, capacity, and timing.

The project is useful for understanding **operations research**, **industrial
scheduling**, and **decision-making problems** commonly found in real-world
production and operations planning.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Task scheduling
- Resource allocation
- Precedence constraints
- Capacity constraints
- Optimization-based decision making
- Schedule visualization (Gantt charts)

---

## Example Use Cases
- Job scheduling in manufacturing systems
- Workforce allocation problems
- Project task planning
- Academic learning of scheduling models
- Operations research demonstrations

---

## Sample Scheduling Scenario
The framework can model simple as well as moderately complex scheduling
problems such as assigning multiple tasks to limited resources while
minimizing delays.

Example concepts include:
- Assigning tasks to one or more resources
- Defining task durations and delay costs
- Ensuring tasks follow a specific order
- Visualizing schedules using Gantt charts
